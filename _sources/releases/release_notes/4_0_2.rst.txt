Release 4.0.2
=============

This is a minor release that fixes CMake build system bug
`#515 <https://github.com/skvadrik/re2c/issues/515>`_
(language-specific binaries erroneously defaulted to generating code for C, e.g.
re2rust worked in the same way as re2c if ``--lang rust`` option wasn't set).
There are also numerous playground improvements.
See the changelog :ref:`releases/changelog/changelog:4.0.2 (2024-12-11)` for details.
