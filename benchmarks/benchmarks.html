<p>Benchmarks are not built by default, as some of them contain large automata that
take considerable time to compile with GCC or Clang. To enable them, configure
with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--enable-benchmarks</span></code> (Autotools) or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-DRE2C_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=yes</span></code>
(CMake). There are a few different groups of benchmarks.</p>

<h2>Submatch (lexer generators)<a class="headerlink" href="#submatch-lexer-generators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>These benchmarks contain regular expressions with submatch markers that are
compiled to C code by a lexer generator, and further compiled to native code by
a C compiler (GCC and Clang). Compilation happens ahead of time, so it is not
included in the run time. The currently supported generators are
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.colm.net/open-source/ragel">ragel</a>
and re2c (no flex, as it does not support submatch extraction).
Regular expressions used in the benchmarks can be divided in two categories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>real-world regular expressions (parsers for HTTP message headers, URI, email
addresses, etc.) ranging from large to small, mostly unambiguous</p></li>
<li><p>artificial regular expressions (a few different groups with emphasis on
alternative, concatenation or repetition) in series of increasing complexity
and ambiguity</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The generated programs find submatch boundaries and count the total length of
all submatch fragments (using submatch results is necessary to prevent
the compiler from optimizing out submatch extraction logic). For each engine
there are simple and buffered variants. In the simple case the whole input is
represented as one continuous block of memory, while in the buffered case the
input is copied into a buffer of smaller size chunk by chunk, so the lexers need
additional logic for buffer refills. For re2c there are two buffered variants
that differ in the way they

<p>Ragel programs are not always correct. This is because ragel cannot
handle non-determinism in the general case. It is a fundamental limitation which
cannot be solved with disambiguation operators, except for simple cases. Ragel
has no notion of <em>tags</em> and <em>tag variables</em>, and its submatch extraction is
based on <em>actions</em> — arbitrary blocks of code embedded in the regular
expression. When ragel generates a DFA, it puts actions either on transitions or
in states (depending on the action type). Non-determinism means that there are
multiple parallel NFA paths with different actions that reach a given DFA state.
Actions on different paths conflict with each other (in particular, an action
can conflict with itself) and change the program state in unforeseen ways (e.g.
overwrite variables set by another action). Disambiguation operators can remove
some of the conflicting actions, but they cannot fork the program state.</p>
<p>re2c uses TDFA(1) algorithm (see the paper
<a class="reference external" href="/2017_trofimovich_tagged_deterministic_finite_automata_with_lookahead.pdf">Tagged Deterministic Finite Automata with Lookahead</a>
for details and benchmarks against other submatch extraction algorithms).
In real-world cases the overhead on submatch extraction is very small, and re2c
is usually a bit faster than ragel (performance and binary size depends a lot on
the C++ compiler being used).
In highly ambiguous artificial cases there is considerable overhead on tracking
multiple versions of non-deterministic tags (which is necessary for correctness),
and re2c is slower than ragel.</p>

<h2>Submatch (libraries, DFA)<a class="headerlink" href="#submatch-libraries-dfa" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This group contains library algorithms for submatch extraction that are based on
deterministic automata. These are regular expressions that undergo just-in-time
determinization before matching, which is included in the run time. Currently
the group contains only two algorithms, TDFA(1) and regless-TDFA(1) — a
modification of TDFA(1) that replaces register operations with a record of tag
history, and a second pass on the history that unfolds it and reconstructs
submatch results. The benchmark also includes variations for POSIX and leftmost
greedy disambiguation policies, since disambiguation is also included in the run
time.</p>
<p>Regless-TDFA(1) bypasses a few expensive computation steps in <em>regcomp()</em>, which
results in much faster determinization times (a few orders of magnitude faster
on large regular expressions). For <em>regexec()</em> the results are divided: on
real-world regular expressions TDFA(1) usually outperforms regless-TDFA(1), but
in some artificially constructed cases it can arbitrarily slower. These are
pathological inputs for TDFA(1); the tags have arbitrarily high degree of
non-determinism (increased with the repetition counter), so TDFA(1) has to track
arbitrary many tag variables. Regless-TDFA(1) does not have tag variables.</p>

<h2>Submatch (libraries, NFA)<a class="headerlink" href="#submatch-libraries-nfa" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This group contains library algorithms for submatch extraction based on
non-deterministic automata. They are described in depth in the paper <a class="reference external" href="/2019_borsotti_trofimovich_efficient_posix_submatch_extraction_on_nfa.pdf">Efficient
POSIX submatch extraction on NFA</a>.
The goal is to compare algorithms that support POSIX longest-match semantics. A
few leftmost greedy algorithms are provided as a baseline, including the Google
RE2 library (which does not support POSIX semantics). There are four different
variations of Okui-Suzuki algorithm, an algorithm proposed by Kuklewicz and a
backward-matching algorithm proposed by Cox (which is generally incorrect).</p>
<p>As the benchmarks show, the basic Okui-Suzuki algorithm the most robust one
among POSIX algorithms. It works in bounded memory that depends only on the
regular expression and does not grow with the input size, and it has reasonable
performance compared to the leftmost-greedy algorithm (although it too has some
pathological cases on regular expressions with high ambiguity level). The lazy
variation of Okui-Suzuki algorithm is often faster, but its memory requirement
is not bounded (it grows with the size of input). Both Kuklewicz and backward
algorithms are much slower on large real-world regular expressions.</p>
